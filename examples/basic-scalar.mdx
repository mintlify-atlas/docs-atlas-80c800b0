This example demonstrates basic scalar arithmetic operations and automatic differentiation in IncliArray.

## Complete Example

```cpp basic_scalars.cpp
#include "../include/NDArray.h"
#include <iostream>

int main(void) {
  NDArray X({1});
  X.randint(1, 10);

  std::cout << "X = ";
  X.print();

  NDArray Y = X * 2;
  NDArray Z = Y + 10;

  Z.backward();

  std::cout << "Grad X = ";
  X.print(NDArray::PrintType::Grad);

  return 0;
}
```

## Step-by-Step Walkthrough

<Steps>
<Step title="Create a scalar array">
  ```cpp
  NDArray X({1});
  X.randint(1, 10);
  ```

  Creates a 1-dimensional array with a single element and initializes it with a random integer between 1 and 10.

  Example output:
  ```
  X = [7]
  ```
</Step>

<Step title="Build computation graph">
  ```cpp
  NDArray Y = X * 2;
  NDArray Z = Y + 10;
  ```

  Performs two operations:
  - Multiply X by 2: `Y = 7 * 2 = 14`
  - Add 10 to Y: `Z = 14 + 10 = 24`

  These operations automatically build a computation graph for autograd.
</Step>

<Step title="Compute gradients">
  ```cpp
  Z.backward();
  ```

  Triggers backpropagation from Z through the computation graph. This computes gradients for all arrays that led to Z.
</Step>

<Step title="Access gradients">
  ```cpp
  X.print(NDArray::PrintType::Grad);
  ```

  Prints the gradient of Z with respect to X.

  Expected output:
  ```
  Grad X = [2]
  ```

  The gradient is 2 because:
  - dZ/dY = 1 (derivative of Y + 10)
  - dY/dX = 2 (derivative of X * 2)
  - dZ/dX = dZ/dY × dY/dX = 1 × 2 = 2
</Step>
</Steps>

## Expected Output

```
X = [7]
Grad X = [2]
```

<Note>
The actual value of X will vary since it's randomly initialized, but the gradient will always be 2.
</Note>

## Key Concepts

- **Computation graph**: Operations are automatically tracked for backpropagation
- **Automatic differentiation**: Call `.backward()` to compute all gradients
- **Gradient access**: Use `PrintType::Grad` to view computed gradients
