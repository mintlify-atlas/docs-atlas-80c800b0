# Installation

IncliArray uses CMake for building and installation. You can either build the examples for development or install the library system-wide for use in your projects.

## Prerequisites

You'll need:
- A C++17 compatible compiler (GCC, Clang, or MSVC)
- CMake 3.10 or higher
- Git (to clone the repository)

## Getting the source

Clone the IncliArray repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/inclinedadarsh/incliarray.git
cd incliarray
```

## Build and run examples

If you want to explore the examples or contribute to development, build with examples enabled:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create build directory">
    Create a separate build directory to keep your source tree clean:
    
    ```bash
    mkdir build && cd build
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Configure with CMake">
    Run CMake to generate build files. By default, `BUILD_EXAMPLES` is ON:
    
    ```bash
    cmake ..
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Build the project">
    Compile the library and examples:
    
    ```bash
    make
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Run examples">
    Execute any of the built examples:
    
    ```bash
    ./examples/basic_scalars
    ./examples/basic_vectors
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  Examples are located in the `examples/` directory. Each example demonstrates different features like scalar operations, vector/matrix operations, and autograd.
</Note>

## Install system-wide

To use IncliArray in your own projects, install it to your system:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create build directory">
    ```bash
    mkdir build && cd build
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Configure without examples">
    Disable examples to speed up the build:
    
    ```bash
    cmake .. -DBUILD_EXAMPLES=OFF
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Install the library">
    Install headers and library files (requires sudo on Linux/macOS):
    
    ```bash
    sudo make install
    ```
    
    This installs:
    - Headers to `/usr/local/include`
    - Library files to `/usr/local/lib`
    - CMake config to `/usr/local/lib/cmake/NDArray`
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  On Windows, you may need to run the installation command from an administrator terminal.
</Warning>

## Use in your project

Once installed, you can use IncliArray in your own C++ projects.

### With CMake

Add these lines to your project's `CMakeLists.txt`:

```cmake
find_package(NDArray REQUIRED)
add_executable(myapp myapp.cpp)
target_link_libraries(myapp PRIVATE NDArray)
```

Then include the header in your code:

```cpp
#include <NDArray.h>

int main() {
  NDArray arr({3, 3});
  arr.ones();
  arr.print();
  return 0;
}
```

### With plain compiler

If you're not using CMake, you can compile directly with g++ or clang:

```bash
g++ -std=c++17 myapp.cpp -lNDArray -o myapp
```

Then run your application:

```bash
./myapp
```

<Note>
  If you installed to a custom prefix, add `-I<include_dir>` and `-L<lib_dir>` flags to specify the include and library paths.
</Note>

## Custom installation prefix

To install to a custom location instead of `/usr/local`:

```bash
cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/install
make install
```

When using a custom prefix, remember to:
- Add the include path when compiling: `-I/path/to/install/include`
- Add the library path when linking: `-L/path/to/install/lib`
- Update `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH` when using CMake's `find_package()`

## Verify installation

Create a simple test file to verify your installation:

```cpp test.cpp
#include <NDArray.h>
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  NDArray test({2, 2});
  test.fillSequential();
  std::cout << "IncliArray is installed correctly!" << std::endl;
  test.print();
  return 0;
}
```

Compile and run:

```bash
g++ -std=c++17 test.cpp -lNDArray -o test
./test
```

You should see output showing a 2x2 matrix with sequential values.
